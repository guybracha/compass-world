## ✨ About the Project
Compass World started as a fun personal project, combining narrative ideas I’ve created over the last **10+ years**.  

The initial vision was to build an interactive webcomic platform inspired by **Homestuck**, where readers could explore the story in a non-linear way. Over time, it evolved into a **worldbuilding hub**, mixing:
- 🦸‍♂️ Original superheroes & villains  
- 🗺️ Fictional locations and history  
- 📚 Narrative arcs & lore  
- 🎨 Concept art and design ideas
